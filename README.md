# about me


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on earning my bachelor's degree in technical communications, communications studies, and french. I know, ambitious! I'm a freshman at Iowa State University, so I have plenty of time to pivot.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub, VSCode, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, as well as several courses.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the Bible and Christianity
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm hypermobile, which means all of my joints go a little farther than normal.
